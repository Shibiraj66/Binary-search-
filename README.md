Here's a sample README content for Binary Search in Java on GitHub:

*Binary Search in Java*

*Overview*

Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list of items. It works by repeatedly dividing in half the portion of the list that could contain the item, until you've narrowed down the possible locations to just one.

*Implementation*

Here is a Java implementation of binary search:

```
public class BinarySearch {

    /**
     * Searches for the target value in a sorted array.
     * 
     * @param arr   the sorted array to search
     * @param target the value to search for
     * @return the index of the target value if found, -1 otherwise
     */
    public static int binarySearch(int[] arr, int target) {
        int left = 0;
        int right = arr.length - 1;

        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;

            // Check if target is present at mid
            if (arr[mid] == target) {
                return mid;
            }

            // If target is greater, ignore left half
            if (arr[mid] < target) {
                left = mid + 1;
            }

            // If target is smaller, ignore right half
            else {
                right = mid - 1;
            }
        }

        // if we reach here, then element was not present
        return -1;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr = {2, 5, 8, 12, 16, 23, 38, 56, 72, 91};
        int target = 23;

        int result = binarySearch(arr, target);

        if (result == -1) {
            System.out.println("Element not present in array");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Element found at index " + result);
        }
    }
}
```

*Example Use Cases*

- Searching for a specific element in a large sorted dataset.
- Finding the index of an element in a sorted array.

*Time Complexity*

- Best-case: O(1)
- Average-case: O(log n)
- Worst-case: O(log n)

*Space Complexity*

- O(1) (auxiliary space)

*Advice for Contributions*
